# Session Context - January 25, 2025

## What We Worked On Today

### 1. Fixed Supabase Configuration
- ✅ Updated API key from incorrect `sb_publishable_` format to correct `eyJ...` anon key
- ✅ Fixed RLS policies by running `fix-rls-policies.sql` 
- ✅ Verified Authentication URL Configuration was already correct
- ✅ Dropped insecure `temp_import` table

### 2. Discovered IT Blocking Issue
- **Problem**: Corporate IT is blocking access to Supabase (`*.supabase.co`)
- **Error**: CORS preflight redirect error when accessing from internal network
- **Impact**: Internal users cannot access calendar events from Supabase
- **Current Workaround**: App successfully falls back to Google Sheets

## Current State

### Working
- External users (outside corporate network) can access the app normally
- Google Sheets fallback works for everyone
- All Supabase configuration is correct

### Not Working  
- Internal users cannot access Supabase data due to IT firewall
- This creates inconsistent experience between internal/external users

## Files Modified
- `/robeson-app/.env.local` - Updated Supabase anon key

## Files Created
- `/fix-rls-policies.sql` - SQL script to fix RLS policies (already run)
- `/fix-supabase-cors.sql` - Diagnostic SQL script
- `/fix-supabase-cors.md` - Documentation for CORS troubleshooting
- `/robeson-app/pages/api/supabase/[...path].ts` - API proxy attempt (won't work with static export)
- `/robeson-app/lib/supabase-proxy.ts` - Proxy client attempt
- `/robeson-app/lib/supabase-with-proxy.ts` - Custom fetch client

## Options Going Forward

### Option 1: IT Whitelisting (Recommended)
- Request IT to whitelist `whzaibvijurovtevwiny.supabase.co`
- Simplest solution, no code changes needed

### Option 2: API Proxy Service
- Deploy a Render web service at `api.robeson.help`
- Service forwards requests to Supabase or connects to Render DB
- Requires additional infrastructure

### Option 3: Keep Google Sheets
- Already working as fallback
- Loses real-time features but works for everyone
- No additional work needed

### Option 4: Render Database + Web Service
- Replace Supabase entirely with Render PostgreSQL
- Requires API web service to expose REST endpoints
- More complex but gives full control

## Next Steps
1. Decide on approach (IT whitelisting vs proxy vs Google Sheets)
2. If proxy: Create Node.js/Express API service for Render
3. If Google Sheets: Remove Supabase code to simplify
4. Test solution with both internal and external users

## Environment Details
- Supabase URL: `https://whzaibvijurovtevwiny.supabase.co`
- Supabase Anon Key: Starts with `eyJhbGc...` (stored in .env.local)
- App URL: `https://robeson.help`
- Current branch: main
- Deployment: Static export (no API routes)

## Questions to Address
- Is IT willing to whitelist Supabase?
- Is the added complexity of a proxy worth it vs using Google Sheets?
- Do you need real-time features that Supabase provides?
